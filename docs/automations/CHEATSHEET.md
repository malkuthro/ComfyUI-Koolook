# Cheat sheet

For someone who already knows the loop. Full docs: [`README.md`](README.md), [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md), and the per-module READMEs (e.g. [`LTX-2.3/base-1step/README.md`](LTX-2.3/base-1step/README.md), [`LTX-2.3/audio-lipsync/README.md`](LTX-2.3/audio-lipsync/README.md)).

## Bootstrap

Bare-bones — what's needed to get the loop running on a fresh machine. Module-specific setup (checkpoints, LoRAs, custom nodes for a particular task, optional fork code) lives in each module's handoff checklist, e.g. [`LTX-2.3/base-1step/handoff-checklist.md`](LTX-2.3/base-1step/handoff-checklist.md).

**Repo side**
- [ ] Python 3.11+ with `pip install Pillow`. On Windows, the absolute path `C:/Python313/python.exe` sidesteps the Microsoft Store stub.
- [ ] Clone the repo.
- [ ] `cp .env.example .env`. Set `KOLOOK_AUTOMATIONS_WORK_DIR=<absolute path>` to a per-project folder. Create the folder if it doesn't exist.

**ComfyUI side**
- [ ] `was-node-suite-comfyui` custom-node pack installed (for the `Text Multiline` node).
- [ ] Three `Text Multiline` nodes in your workflow, titled exactly:
  - `Working_Folder_PATH` — body: one absolute path matching `KOLOOK_AUTOMATIONS_WORK_DIR`.
  - `OVERLAY - INFO` — body: free-form, with a `BASE (notes):` section for Δ-from-baseline notes.
  - `OVERLAY - FEEDBACK` — body: observations + optional score lines (see syntax below).
- [ ] `Workflow → Save (API Format)` writes the JSON into the working folder.

**First card**
- [ ] In Claude Code: `/make-card`.
- [ ] Expect `_AI/card.png` + `_AI/iterations.md` in the working folder; PNG appears inline.

If that works, you're set. Everything else in this cheat sheet is reminders for the daily loop.

## ComfyUI

Three Text Multiline nodes drive everything. Match by title (case-insensitive).

| Node title | Edit when | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `OVERLAY - INFO` | Before render | Free-form summary. The card pulls the `BASE (notes):` section as "Δ from baseline." |
| `OVERLAY - FEEDBACK` | After watching the video | Observations + score lines (see syntax below). |
| `Working_Folder_PATH` | Only when switching projects | One absolute path, forward slashes. |

**Score syntax** inside `OVERLAY - FEEDBACK`:

```
motion: 4/5
sync: 5/5
sharp: 4/5
```

Case-insensitive · `/5` optional · integer 0–5 · non-matching lines stay as feedback text.

**Workflow save:** `Workflow → Save (API Format)` → save into the working folder. The metadata-bundle JSON ComfyUI writes (`<name>_<seq>.json`) works natively.

---

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/make-card` | Auto-discover newest JSON in working folder → render card → show inline. |
| `python scripts/make_card.py` | Same as `/make-card`, from a terminal. |
| `python scripts/make_card.py <wf.json>` | Render a specific JSON. |
| `python scripts/make_card.py <wf.json> <out.png>` | Render to a custom output path. |
| `python scripts/watch_cards.py` | Hands-free background poller — re-renders the card on every JSON save. |

On Windows, replace `python` with `C:/Python313/python.exe` if the Microsoft Store stub gets in the way.

## Folder structure

```

### Working-folder-side (per project — pointed at by `KOLOOK_AUTOMATIONS_WORK_DIR`)

```
<working folder>/
├── <workflow>.json                     ← user content — save here from ComfyUI
├── <workflow>.mp4                      ← user content — ComfyUI writes here
├── …more JSONs/MP4s as you iterate
└── _AI/                                ← agent-managed
    ├── card.png                        stable name — overwritten each run
    └── iterations.md                   append-only log, one row per render
```

Wipe `_AI/` to reset the agent's tracking history without touching renders. Wipe the JSONs/MP4s without losing the iteration log.

## Conventions

- **One JSON = one iteration.** Don't overwrite the same JSON across substantively different runs.
- **`loop` in the filename = post-card output, skipped.** When ComfyUI saves the composited-with-card video back into the working folder, name it `<base>_loop_<seq>.mp4` (and pair JSON). Auto-discovery ignores anything with `loop` in the stem, so the script never feeds its own output back as input.
- **Card filename is stable.** Wire your NLE to `_AI/card.png` once.
- **Seed = 12 (fixed)** while sweeping any other knob. Vary seed only after a setting stabilises.
- **Scheduler = `linear_quadratic` (8 steps)** — locked-in finding. See [`LTX-2.3/base-1step/findings.md`](LTX-2.3/base-1step/findings.md).
- **Promote** a hypothesis to a finding when it's stable across ≥ 3 runs in `_AI/iterations.md`.
- **Run label** on the card: prefers `v01`-style; falls back to `_00001` sequence numbers; else `?`.
- **Switching projects:** update `Working_Folder_PATH` node + `.env`. Node wins on mismatch.

## Quick-fail diagnostics

| Card says… | Means… |
|---|---|
| `Run ?` | Filename has neither `v<N>` nor `_<NNNNN>`. Rename or accept the `?`. |
| `Render time —` | ComfyUI log not found (set `KOLOOK_COMFYUI_LOG` or `KOLOOK_COMFYUI_DEV_PATH` in `.env`) AND no EXR sequence in the working folder. |
| `Outcome … ?/5` | `OVERLAY - FEEDBACK` has no `motion:` / `sync:` / `sharp:` lines yet. |
| Card writes to wrong folder | `Working_Folder_PATH` and `.env` disagree — node wins; align them. |
| `KOLOOK_AUTOMATIONS_WORK_DIR not set` | Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill the var. |
