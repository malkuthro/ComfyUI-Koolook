# Runpod_Comfy

This module is organized in three top-level folders:

- `setup/` → operator-facing inputs and helper tools
- `image/` → generated build artifacts, active lock set, and deploy runbook
- `core/` → runtime internals (docker/scripts) and technical references

Start here:
- `Runpod_Comfy/setup/USER_README.md`
